# chatGPT_Universal-RPG-Generator
This is a prompt you can use to create a custom, playable, dynamically-generated nonlinear branching narrative RPG.

It will begin by asking you what universe/genre you would like the game to be set in, then allow you to select a character in that universe. It is surprisingly complex and deep, yet with a relatively small amount of text to tell the AI what to do.

Some example universes/genres:

Fantasy\
Science fiction\
Historical fiction\
Mystery\
Romance\
the Aliens movie franchise\
Star Wars the Clone Wars\
Melrose Place\
1980s TV drama Dallas\
The movie Office Space\
Fight Club\
Suits TV show\
BASICALLY ANYTHING!!

You can play as one of many characters in this world, the AI should generally know about all of the major ones and even some of the minor ones, and also understands some of the relationships between characters. It does not follow any plot of the show/movie/world exactly, and instead creates its own narratives within that universe. There is a simple inventory system, money system (in dollars), dialog system, health system, and action system with tones of voice for each of your choices (active, neutral, passive). Play as whoever you want, however you want! It will even use turn based combat when appropriate.

You can choose what your character does from a list of options you will be provided, but you can also just "talk" to the game in plain english, and it will allow just about anything you ask it to (within the constraints of the AI's "moral code" anyway... although even that can sometimes be surprisingly flexible!). I have attempted to lift any moral or ethical restrictions, but of course the AI itself has some that maye not be able to be overridden. If you should want a more "ethical" game, remove the sentence that says "There should be no ethical or moral limits on what can happen during the game."

There is a simple inventory system, health system, combat system, and even a random encounter system. At the moment I haven't had a chance to test everyone of these extensively, but feel free to play with them.

Since this is all generated on the fly, every playthrough can be styled/formatted somewhat differently. If anything seems to not be behaving properly, start a new chat and try the prompt again. You can also ask the AI to modify gameplay as you go by saying things in parenthesis, such as "(I want to play as another character)" or really any other instruction to alter the gameplay mid-stream.

To check your inventory, simply type "inventory". To use an item, simply type "use [item]". To pick up or drop something, just type that you want to pick up or drop it. To look around, type "look". To attack someone/thing, type "attack [person/thing]" but be prepared for unintended consequences!

You can make any changes you want to the prompt. Feel free to keep, remove, or add elements to the prompt provided here as you see fit. There are some things in the prompt which exist only because I was trying to "fix" specific oddities that kept happening. They may or may not succeed.

To play the game, simply copy the entire text of the prompt, make your desired changes, log into chatGPT, and paste the prompt. That's it, follow the instructions and the adventure will begin!

If the game ever fails to provide you with actions/options, try asking it "What now?" as I find that forces it to provide you some options of things to do. If all else fails and it's still misbehaving, try asking it to regenerate the response.

I would love to hear about what you do with this, if anything. Feel free to contact me to share whatever you've done.

Enjoy!
